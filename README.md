# odin-etch-a-sketch

an etch-a-sketch project for the odin project

This has been a lot of fun, it was slow in the beginning but it rapidly picked up in pace after i set the plans, which came after i realized what the problems i'm supposed to solve

also rainbows are cool

after looking at some TOP solutions, it seems i don't understand what an etch a sketch is ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ 
i'll remember to come back and actually add the etch-a-sketch functionality(click events and such) and make it more responsive on top
